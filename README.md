# jCal

jCal is a simple jQuery plugin for date selection. It doesn't rely on any other plugins (like the jQuery UI) so it is relatively lightweight compared to other alternatives.

The interface provides buttons for selecting the current day, the month (without specifying a day), or clearing the input field altogether.

Although it does not require Twitter Bootstrap, jCal works nicely with it, and uses the Bootstrap button classes on the UI controls.
